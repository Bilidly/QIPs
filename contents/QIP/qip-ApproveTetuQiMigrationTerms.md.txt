### Summary

This proposal is for the Qi Dao community to decide how to compensate wallets with small balances of TetuQi in order for the Tetu team to continue to migrate these locked TetuQi funds to Ethereum.

The community would decide between a few options:
1. For TetuQi holding wallets of less than 10 USD value (currently ~500 Qi or TetuQi), compensate them with up to $10 USDC on Polygon Chain, turn their TetuQi funds to dust.
2. For TetuQi holding wallets of less than 10 USD value (currently ~500 Qi or TetuQi), compensate them with up to $20 USDC on Polygon Chain, turn their TetuQi funds to dust.
3. Do not compensate TetuQi holders with small balances. Turn those funds to dust/burn and continue to migrate the larger holders
4. Further discussion needed.

On Approval, our choice of action on these small balance TetuQi wallets would be passed to the Tetu team who would be able to start a migration of the other TetuQi funds on to the Ethereum network.

### Motivation

There are 302 wallets with Qi Tokens locked in the pegged TetuQi token on the Tetu platform on the Polygon network. Our Qi governance token has now migrated to Ethereum, but that has left these locked up TetuQi stuck on Polygon. Tetu would be willing to migrate tokens to Ethereum, but they are concerned about the number of wallets that hold very low $USD balances of TetuQi and want the Qi Dao community to agree what action to take for those small balance wallets before moving forward with a migration.

For multiple years, owners of Qi tokens were able to lock their tokens in the Tetu platform on the Polygon network to mint TetuQi tokens. There have been talks for over 9 months now with the Tetu team and within the Dao about migrating these locked up TetuQi tokens to Ethereum. The Tetu team has agreed to migrate tokens, but those talks have stalled between our two groups for months now. It is time for the QiDao governance members to decide what to do on this matter.

This would be similar to tokens being migrated by Beefy.Fi onto Ethereum.

### Specification

Between Tetu and Qi Dao teams, it has been placed onto our Dao to propose and agree as to what happens to small balances of TetuQi holders. It is not economical to pay gas fees to transfer these small balances, ~260 wallets of which are <10 $USDC value currently.

### Rationale

There are 302 holders of TetuQi according to PolygonScan, only 40 of these have more than 500 TetuQi / Qi in value going off a previously compiled list of TetuQi holders assembled 3 months ago: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_irOFhIo7ykDNk0wQFHbmD5_D1bNI0lr9dxCD8kYg2Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0

Option 1: At the current price, 10 USDC = ~500 Qi. We would be buying out these small wallets at UP TO $10 + gas cost in compensation. Cost: Up to 2600 USDC + Gas

Option 2: We would compensate these small balance wallets with up to 20 USDC. Qi has had had some positive price action in the last year. This would buy out small wallets at a price around .04 cents / Qi, a price that Qi held above for ~2 months in the last year. Cost: Up to 5200 USDC + Gas

Option 3: The cheapest way to move forward for the protocol, but may burn some of the current Qi Dao community members.

Option 4: Further discussion in the Qip Discussion Discord

It is not economical to migrate these small balances to Ethereum as it would cost the platforms much more in gas fees than the balances would be worth at least in the near/mid future.


### Technical Specification

The resolution would be a confirmed decision by the DAO which would be taken by the development team or community to the Tetu team and they could migrate these tokens to an Ethereum product. 

### Configurable Values

Please list all values configurable under this implementation, if applicable.
